I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Texas A & M University](https://agrilifepeople.tamu.edu/people/view/38860). 
I obtained my [PhD in Economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara](https://econ.ucsb.edu/people/students/dario-trujano-ochoa), where I developed research in Experimental and Behavioral Economics. 
My research is centered on how individuals process information, form beliefs, and make decisions under uncertainty, focusing on misinformation and risk preferences. 
I combine experimental methods and theoretical modeling to explore these areas, particularly higher-order beliefs, feedback mechanisms, and how people value information.

Iâ€™m excited to continue my work in economic research, focusing on information economics and decision theory.
My [Job Market Paper](https://dariotrujanoochoa.github.io/portfolio/2024-10-30-feedbackMisinfo-2/) explored the effect of feedback on the demand for verification in the context of misinformation. The results aim to help design more effective interventions to fight misinformation.

Where am I from?
======

I was born and raised in beautiful and chaotic Mexico City. There, I studied Psychology and Applied Statistics at UNAM. 
I became interested in experimental methods and behavior models. Then, I completed my Master's in Economics at CIDE, where I was exposed to rigorous mathematical analysis. 
After graduation, I worked at [IFT](https://www.ift.org.mx/) and [ASBA](https://asbasupervision.org/), and began my PhD at UCSB in 2019, from which I graduated in 2025. 


Where am I going next?
======

I will publish ongoing projects and start new projects. I expect to be back in the job market by 2027.
